##  Frontend Question

### **Question**
Build a simple React web page that fetches and displays user data from an API:  
 `https://reqres.in/api/users`

**Requirements:**
- Fetch and display user list in a table or card layout  
- Search by name or email  
- Sort (by name or email)  
- Filter (e.g., by email domain)  
- Pagination  
- Optional: Loading spinner, responsive UI, deploy link  

---

### **Short Answer / Implementation Summary**
 Created a **React + Vite + Tailwind CSS** web app that:
- Fetches users dynamically from the API  
- Implements **search, filter, sort, and pagination**  
- Includes a **loading spinner & responsive design**  
- Deployed successfully on **Vercel**

**API Used:**  
`https://randomuser.me/api` (used instead of reqres.in to avoid CORS/auth issues)

##  DSA Question

### **Question**
Implement basic DSA-based coding problems (example types):  
- Reverse a linked list  
- Check for palindrome string  
- Find missing number in an array  
- Binary search implementation  
- Sort an array (quick sort / merge sort)

---

### **Short Answer**
 Implemented efficient **DSA solutions** using optimal time and space complexity:
- Used **iterative and recursive approaches** where applicable  
- Focused on **clarity, modularity, and performance**  
- Time complexity explained in comments for each function
